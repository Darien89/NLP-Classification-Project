Surprisingly, words 'year' and 'new' are 2nd and 3rd most frequently appeared. It may mean that cat owners like to find new items/activities yearly for the cats or maybe it is simply the owners spend the new year with their cats.  "

    "<li> For modeling rigor, literal subreddit name references should have been removed as individual words (e.g. \"dog\", \"cat\") were left in earlier on.\n",
    "<li> Additional stopwords 'ing' should be removed.\n",
    "<li>Having posts with more unique words helps to distinguish between spam and ham but;\n",
    "<li>Not all posts with unique words are relevant, so we have to focus more on the coefficient of frequently appearing words\n",
    "<li> Perhaps this project could be improved by performing a form of sentiment analysis on the data in future studies. Lastly, though this model scored only around ~ 90% accuracy on testing data, this model still predicts much better than the baseline (~ 50%) and might be helpful in differentiating between dogs and cats.\n",
    "<li> To consider using TifdVectorizer and compare the scores.\n",
    "<li> Further analysis can be done on the emojis within the titles."

    "<li>Explore other forums that are more local e.g. Hardwarezone as Reddit posts are more global and may not attune well to local context. Starting small within the local context would be a better way to 'test' the market first.\n",
    "<li>r/dogs - more practical and ‘discussion’ driven (e.g. how to train your dogs not to bark too often).\n",
    "<li>Create consultancy and onboarding services for new dog owners.\n",
    "<li>If interested to bring in breeds, the top words can signify the popular ones among dog lovers and you may even mate two different breeds together to get a crossbreed.\n",
    "<li>r/cats - sharing of digital media.\n",
    "<li>Grooming services, venture into F&B (e.g. cat café) or even match making company."
